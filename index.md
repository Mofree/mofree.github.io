## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mofree/mofree.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mofree/mofree.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

[Line breaks in markdown](https://gist.github.com/shaunlebron/746476e6e7a4d698b373): Personal repository about line breaks in github Markdown.  

I got my homepage now, but how can I make more pages for my website?  
[Creating new files](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/creating-new-files)  
After I created a new .md file, I found it didn't show in my chosen Jekyll theme.
